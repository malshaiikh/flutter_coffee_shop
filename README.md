# flutter_coffee_shop
A simple Flutter coffee shop app built using Flutter and Provider for state management. 
This project is based on a [YouTube tutorial by Mitch Koko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPvhoghXn54), and has been extended with additional features and functionality.

## Features

- Browse coffee list
- Select item quantity and size 
- Add items to cart
- Prevent adding duplicate items (same coffee & same size)
- Remove items from cart
- Live total price calculation

> The quantity/size selection, total price calculation, and duplicate prevention logic were implemented beyond the original tutorial.
